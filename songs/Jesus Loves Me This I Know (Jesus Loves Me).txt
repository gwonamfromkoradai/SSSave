Jesus Loves Me This I Know (Jesus Loves Me)

Verse 1
Jesus loves me
This I know
For the Bible tells me so
Little ones to Him belong
They are weak but He is strong

Chorus
Yes Jesus loves me
Yes Jesus loves me
Yes Jesus loves me
The Bible tells me so

Verse 2
Jesus loves me
He who died
Heaven's gate to open wide
He will wash away my sin
Let His little child come in

Verse 3
Jesus loves me He will stay
Close beside me all the way
On the cross You died for me
I will ever live for Thee
